Your response goes here!
1) I've learned how powerful the <p> tag is. I have never learned html in a systematic way. Though it looks simple, but to implement a specific mock-up requires more effort that I thought. It is a good exercise.
2) The easy part is to lossely generate a webpage.
3) The difficult part is to implement the exact details.
4) Keep a positive attitude to face each problem, big or small and find the right solution. Do not be discouarged by difficulty yet do not underestimate the potential pit and falls.
