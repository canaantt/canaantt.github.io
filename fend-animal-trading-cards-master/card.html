			<p class="firstLine">Throughout North and South America lives one of Godâ€™s most amazing creatures, the hummingbird.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Trochilidae</li>
				<li><span>Average Length</span>: 2.4 in</li>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: 5 years</li>
				<li><span>Habitat</span>: most live in the tropics</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Probably the best-known characteristics of the hummingbird are its extremely rapid wing-beat and its amazing ability to manoeuvre. It can hover, it can fly backwards and sideways. Rufous hummingbirds migrate great distances, from as far as Alaska to Mexico each year. On the west coast they are able to stop at various places and feed a week or two to build their fuel storage.</p>
